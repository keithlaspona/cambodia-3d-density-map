# Cambodia Population Density Map

This project is a **Cambodia Population Density Map** created using **R Studio**. The map visualizes population density data across Cambodia, offering insights into regional variations and demographic distribution. The project utilizes geospatial data and population statistics to create an interactive and informative map.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a visual representation of the population density across different regions of Cambodia. The map is designed to display areas with varying population densities, helping to identify trends and make data-driven decisions related to population planning and resource distribution.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of Cambodia's population density.
- Visualization based on geospatial data and demographic statistics.
- Easy to interpret heatmap showing population distribution across regions.

## Visualization

The final population density map for Cambodia is shown below. The map visualizes the population distribution across various regions of Cambodia, with key cities marked for easy reference.
